# Food Chain 2 for Grasshopper

Food Chain 2 offers a set of components to work with RDF data inside of Grasshopper.
It takes advantage of Hops Server to access CPython 3 libraries and access ontologies from within Grasshopper.

It is still in an early stage of development and currently work in progress...

## Using Food Chain

After cloning this repository, open a console and create a virtual environment in Python 3.8 or above.
After the environment is created, activate it and install all the necessary requirements:
```
pip install requirements.txt 
```

To start the server, with the environment active, navigate to the directory to where you cloned Foodchain2 and run:
```
python app\app.py
```

For more information regarding Hops component and how to use it, please refer to [Hops documentation](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/compute/hops-component/)
